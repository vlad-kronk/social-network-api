## Description 

This social network API is a web interface used to build and maintain a database that keeps track of users, their friends, their thoughts (posts), and other users' reactions to those thoughts. It utilizes MongoDB, a NoSQL database.

## User Story

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
